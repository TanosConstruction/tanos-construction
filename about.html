      <h2>Our Story</h2>
      <p>Our company’s roots stretch back to 1990 when Tano started Almendarez Construction Company as a solo venture. Over the following decade and a half, he built a reputation for quality workmanship and reliable service. In September 2005 we evolved into Tano’s Construction Company, continuing our tradition while embracing new techniques and technologies.</p>
      <p>With more than 42 years of experience, we have successfully completed a diverse range of residential projects including custom homes, additions, kitchen and bathroom remodels, outdoor living areas and complete renovations. Our team combines seasoned craftsmanship with modern project management tools to deliver work on time and within budget.</p>
